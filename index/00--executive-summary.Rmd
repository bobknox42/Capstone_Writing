**OBJECTIVE:** Our research was to find exogenous variables derived from social media data in order to improve the forecasts of Scholle IPN's tomato bag shipments on a monthly basis.

**METHODS:** We used natural language processing and time-series analysis to forecast tomato bag shipments.

**RESULTS:** We were able to generate a model that performed better than the baseline model of tomato bag shipments.

**CONCLUSIONS:** There is some predictive power generated from social media data with respect to tomato bag shipments.
