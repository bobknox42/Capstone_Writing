Abstract

Our research was to find exogenous variables derived from social media data in order to improve the forecasts of Scholle IPN's tomato bag shipments on a monthly basis. We leveraged two data sources to help forecast shipments, Google Trends and Twitter. Google Trends data collected the relative frequency of certain keyword searches over the research period of 2007 to 2018. Twitter data collected tweets containing keywords over the research period of 2007 to 2018. These tweets were then processed using open-source natural language processing libraries to determine the tweet's sentimentality of positive or negative. Several models were created, validated and ensembled to produce the best model to forecast tomato bag shipments.
