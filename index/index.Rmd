# If you are creating a PDF you'll need to write your preliminary content as well as define some other parameters below.
abstract: | 
  `r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) paste(readLines("00--abstract.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')` 
executive: |  
  `r if(knitr:::is_latex_output()) paste(readLines("00--executive-summary.Rmd"), collapse = '\n  ')` 
#
# Longer preliminary content, like the Abstract and Executive Summary above, is best organized in seperate files.
# The inline r function is used above to paste the contents of those files, instead of requiring you one to type 
# lengthy text directly into the yaml header. For shorter messages, typing directly into the YAML is easier. See below.
# VERY IMPORTANT: A tab indent is needed on the line following the | .
#
preface: |
  A preface is OPTIONAL. Use a preface if you want to explain your interest in the report topic and include anything about your experience that readers should keep in mind. If you would rather not include a preface, comment it out or delete it from the YAML header of the index.Rmd file.

#  I want to thank a few people.

#  You can have a dedication here if you wish.

<!--
Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Preface for example, simply delete lines 32-33 above or add a "#"" before them to comment out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this:
-->

<!--

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, delete the extra .Rmd file and then knit again.
-->

<!-- You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the _bookdown.yml file for PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there. Do not include 00(two-hyphens)prelim.Rmd,  00(two-hyphens)abstract.Rmd and 00(two-hyphens)executive summary.Rmdsince they are handled in the YAML above differently for the PDF version.
-->

<!-- The {.unnumbered} option here means that the introduction will be "Chapter 0." You can also use {-} for no numbers on chapters, which is the standard for each section.
